Following [Hello World guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) form GitHub

I am a mathematician studing data science and pursuing a career change into this emerging/rebranded feild.

Would you like an life-long learner on your team? One with extensive mathematical training and a love of ideas?
Then please look over my [resume](https://github.com/EricDFay/resume) or contact me.

I found [Beginning Git and Github for Linux Users](https://www.linux.com/learn/beginning-git-and-github-linux-users) from linux.com to be another useful tutorial. This one focused on how to use git and GitHub from a remote console or terminal.
